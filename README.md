## ðŸ“˜ Project Overview
This project implements and evaluates a Logistic Regression model using the Iris dataset.
It demonstrates a complete machine-learning workflowâ€”from data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, to cross-validation, learning-curve analysis, and an optional model comparison.

### Objectives
1. Apply proper data preprocessing and splitting techniques.  
2. Train and evaluate a Logistic Regression model for classification.  
3. Assess model performance using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score.  
4. Validate model reliability through 5-Fold Cross Validation.  
5. Visualize the modelâ€™s learning behavior using a Learning Curve.  
6. Compare Logistic Regression with Decision Tree and SVM (optional +10 pts).
